# Portfolio-Website
I am excited to create my first portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will showcase my skills, creativity, and passion for web development. Through this portfolio, I aim to present my projects, highlight my technical expertise, and provide insights into my journey as a computer engineering student.
